# The Adventures of Leeroy Jenkins

A handful of basic Ruby classes that collectively form a crude text-based adventure game.  This was built with the intent of having new developers expand its content and functionality with additional classes, refactoring, and more.  The focus here is less on the game or its story-telling (which, I hope, is self-apparent) and moreso on seeing what indivduals are capable of doing with Ruby!
